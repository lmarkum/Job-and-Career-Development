#Questions for job Interviews

The document isn't intended as a list of questions that must be asked. Rather, it is meant as a way to get you thinking about the 
types of questions one could ask in an interview.


The document is grouped into various sections with similar questions.

Typically, the company culture and benefits questions are topics to cover with HR.

Everything beyond section 1 is meant to be discussed with the hiring manager or other person interviewing you.That person or persons will have knowledge of how the IT department in general, and the team you're interviewing for, will work. 

Some questions are variations of the same concept. This is done on purpose to provide you with options with respect to how 
you ask the question. Some versions of questions may be preferred over others by different people.
